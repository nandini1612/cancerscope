# CancerScope

> A minimal, full-stack application for breast cancer detection using both diagnostic data and ultrasound images. This project predicts breast cancer (benign vs malignant) from ultrasound images using the BUSI dataset. The backend is built with Flask, and the model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) along with Grad-CAM for explainability.

## About the Project

**CancerScope** is a full-stack machine learning web application built to demonstrate how AI can assist in breast cancer detection â€” in a clear, accessible, and educational way.

The app supports predictions from both **tabular diagnostic features** and **tissue image patches**, and provides **visual explanations** for how the models arrive at their decisions. Itâ€™s designed not for clinical use, but for **learning**, **awareness**, and **responsible tech education**.

## Why I Built It

I wanted to build something that wasnâ€™t just a machine learning model in a notebook. I wanted a project that could show:

- How ML can work across different types of healthcare data
- What explainability looks like when applied to real problems
- That technical projects can also be simple, minimal, and meaningful

Breast cancer affects millions, and early detection can be life-changing. This project is my attempt to combine data science, design, and purpose in one place.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React.js
- TailwindCSS
- Recharts / D3.js

### Backend + ML Integration
- Python (Flask)
- scikit-learn (tabular models)
- TensorFlow / Keras (image model)
- SHAP for explainability
- Grad-CAM for CNN heatmaps

## Datasets Used

### UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset
- Tabular data from fine needle aspirates of breast masses
- Features like radius, texture, area, smoothness, etc.
- Labels: Benign or Malignant

### BUSI (Breast Ultrasound Images)
- Classes: Benign (normal + benign) and Malignant
- Total: 780 images (approx.)
- Images are preprocessed (224x224, normalized) before feeding into the CNN.


### Deployment

## Evaluation Metrics

This project includes real-world health metrics beyond just accuracy:

- Sensitivity (Recall)
- Specificity
- ROC-AUC and PR-AUC
- Confusion Matrix
- Calibration curve

These metrics help better understand the modelâ€™s performance under different thresholds and in real clinical scenarios.
