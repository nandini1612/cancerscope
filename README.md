## About the Project

**CancerScope** is a full-stack machine learning web application built to demonstrate how AI can assist in breast cancer detection â€” in a clear, accessible, and educational way.

The app supports predictions from both **tabular diagnostic features** and **tissue image patches**, and provides **visual explanations** for how the models arrive at their decisions. Itâ€™s designed not for clinical use, but for **learning**, **awareness**, and **responsible tech education**.

## Why I Built It

I wanted to build something that wasnâ€™t just a machine learning model in a notebook. I wanted a project that could show:

- How ML can work across different types of healthcare data
- What explainability looks like when applied to real problems
- That technical projects can also be simple, minimal, and meaningful

Breast cancer affects millions, and early detection can be life-changing. This project is my attempt to combine data science, design, and purpose in one place.

## Datasets Used

### UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset
- Tabular data from fine needle aspirates of breast masses
- Features like radius, texture, area, smoothness, etc.
- Labels: Benign or Malignant

### IDC Histopathology Image Dataset (Kaggle)
- Microscopic image patches (50x50) of breast tissue
- Binary classification: IDC (malignant) or benign
- Used for CNN training and Grad-CAM visualizations

## Evaluation Metrics

This project includes real-world health metrics beyond just accuracy:

- Sensitivity (Recall)
- Specificity
- ROC-AUC and PR-AUC
- Confusion Matrix
- Calibration curve

These metrics help better understand the modelâ€™s performance under different thresholds and in real clinical scenarios.
